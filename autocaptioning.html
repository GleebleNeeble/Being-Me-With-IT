# Auto-captioning

## Zoom

Zoom contains a setting which you can enable to provide auto-captioning for your meetings and other Zoom events. The steps to enable captioning are outlined in Zoom's knowledge-base [here](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/207279736-Getting-Started-with-Closed-Captioning)

## WebCaptioner

Some very cool folks run the site [https://webcaptioner.com/](https://webcaptioner.com/) which provides a free closed caption tool for calls and events. They are funded exclusively by donations.
