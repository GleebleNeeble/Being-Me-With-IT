## Fonts for dyslexia

If you're dyslexic there's a font called OpenDyslexic which you can download from [here](https://github.com/antijingoist/opendyslexic) and set up on your Mac (or other devices). There's an article on how to install it [here](https://desk.zoho.com/portal/abbiecodes/en/kb/articles/installing-using-opendyslexic) and in Chrome you can go to `chrome://settings/fonts` (paste that into your browser address bar) to configure your default browser fonts.
