# Being Me With IT

The idea behind this project is to make using computers more accessible for everyone. 

There is no specific focus here on IT in the workplace or at home, but if a solution is not suitable for commercial use or costs money then that should be highlighted.

In some cases there will be reference to specific tools to use or install, and in others the focus will be on making settings/options within popular workplace software easier to find and use.

Anyone is welcome to contribute or copy from this project - it is covered by the Unlicense.
